    "#### 1.1  A description of the problem and a discussion of the background\n",
    "I am currently working in Toronto, Canada. I have been here for a while and have kept moving places frequently until I started living in my current neighborhood. I am excited that I got a new job offer in NewYork. I would be moving there in a month. I need to locate a neighborhood similar to my current one in Toronto as I like the amenities around me. Since I have moved around a lot I know that I will not be very happy to settle down in a very different neighborhood. My conditions are that I should get to walk to my new office while being able to enjoy similar amenities as I am currently enjoying in Toronto.  But, NewYork is not familiar for me as I have never travelled to US. I would like to solve this as a data science problem using the location data available from foursquare api. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Clear definition of business problem and potential audience\n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem is to identify a neighborhood in Newyork ,USA with facilities similar to those being enjoyed in Toronto, Canada, NZ. The addresses of source (St Patrick street, Toronto) and target city (West Houston Street, Manhattan, NewYork)are given.However, the facilities that make the neighborhoods similar need to be identified based on location data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, I am solving this as a data science problem for my own purpose. But, this problem and its solution can be scaled for other people. This will be useful for people moving from one city to another city to select a favorite neighborhood in the target city. I am interested to develop an app later based on my solution. It should be able to have conditions based on my favorite amenities and desired location in target city similar to those being enjoyed in the current city.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Source of data\n",
    "**Given Information :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Source address : St Patrick street, Toronto, Canada\n",
    "\n",
    "Target address : West Houston Street, Manhattan, NewYork\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neighborhood Dataset for Toronto :** \n",
    "    Get data by scraping the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe. Process the dataset as described in week 3 Assignment. A few dataframes from this assignment will be used to prepare dataset for current problem\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Neighborhood Dataset for NewYork :**\n",
    "NewYork neighborhood has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood.Luckily, this dataset exists for free on the web. Feel free to try to find this dataset on your own, but here is the link to the dataset: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572. Alternatively, obtain 'newyork_data.json' from  https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\n",
    "Segment and explore them as described in Week 3 Lab. A few dataframes from this Lab will be used to prepare dataset for current problem\n",
    "#### 2.2 Description of data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the foursquare location data acquired for the neighborhoods of Toronto and NewYork. The final dataset used for this project is made by merging required data from Week3 Assignment data - Neighborhood datasets related to Toronto and NewYork. The logic used to merge and collate the data is described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the clustering of Toronto neighborhoods (Week3 Assignment) , the clustered data shows two neighborhoods nearest to the source address are clustered together.  These two neighborhoods are 1)Kensington Market, Chinatown, Grange Park and 2) Toronto Dominion Centre, Design Exchange. The data related to these neighborhoods point to the user's current interests. This can be then used in combination with NewYork neighborhoods data to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)manhattan_toronto_grouped_clustering.csv**\n",
    "This data is prepared by merging the grouped_clustering dataframes of Manhattan neighborhood clustering and selected neighborhoods in toronto clustering. It is passed as input to the combined k-means clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "**2)mh_tor_data.csv**\n",
    "This contains the merged location info for selected Toronto neighborhoods and all Manhattan neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3)mh_tor_neighborhoods_venues_sorted.csv**\n",
    "This data will be used to identify the most favorite amenities preferred by the user.neighborhood_venues_sorted dataframe contains the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood sorted based on their popularity in that neighborhood. From the neighborhood_venues_sorted dataframe, the rows related to these two neighborhoods are selected. Thus the user's favorite amenities are identified. This is merged with neighborhood_venues_sorted dataframe from Manhattan Clustering problem. Thus the merged mh_tor_neighborhoods_venues_sorted.csv is obtained\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are stored in following csv files:\n",
    "1) manhattan_toronto_grouped_clustering.csv\n",
    "2) mh_tor_data.csv\n",
    "3) mh_tor_neighborhoods_venues_sorted.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 How the data is used to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "From the clustering of Toronto neighborhoods (Week3 Assignment) , the clustered data shows two neighborhoods nearest to the source address are clustered together.  These two neighborhoods are 1)Kensington Market, Chinatown, Grange Park and 2) Toronto Dominion Centre, Design Exchange. The data related to these neighborhoods point to the user's current interests. This can be then used in combination with NewYork neighborhoods data to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant data from these two neighborhoods and the Manhattan neighborhoods are merged and saved as explained in previous section. Now, this combined data will be segmented using k-means clustering. The cluster containing the two selected Toronto neighborhood will provide the Newyork neighborhoods matching with them, in terms of the amenities. From this reduced list of Newyork neighborhoods, the user can identify the neighborhood closest to his potential office. This will find the right neighborhood for him and satisfy all his conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology \n",
    "(Section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem discussed here is intended to help a user to locate a neighborhood close to his potential NewYork office. Source address of user is given as a street address in Toronto, Canada. An inferential data analysis was performed based on the Week3 clustering assignment (clustering of Toronto neighborhoods). From these clustering results, the clusters with those neighborhoods close to the source address (Kensington Market and Toronto Dominion Centre)are considered to be containing user's favorite venues. The neighborhood data related to those clusters are merged with the corresponding data for NewYork neighborhoods. Specifically, Manhattan neighborhoods are used here since the target address is in Manhattan area. The data sources, merging logic and data description are presented in the data section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merged dataset is then used to solve the problem using machine learning techniques as explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, k-means clustering technique is applied to segment the neighborhoods into clusters with similar features. The cluster containing the two selected Toronto neighborhood will provide the Newyork neighborhoods matching with them, in terms of the amenities. From this reduced list of Newyork neighborhoods, the user can identify the neighborhood closest to his potential office. This will find the right neighborhood for him and satisfy all his conditions.\n"

    "In this report, the location data derived from https://foursquare.com/ has been used effectively to solve a data science problem. The neighborhood data from two different cities are merged to define a new dataset. The solution can be generalised for use of wider audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The system is developed in such a way that **user just needs to give the source address and target address**. Then the **favorite amenities of the user are automatically identified by the system** using the location data from the source city. These amenities are matched against the target city neighborhoods to choose the right target city neighborhood for the user. The right one is that neighborhood which satisfies all the conditions of the user inclusing the proximity to the target address.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick comparison between the neighborhoods in the selected cluster (Cluster0) reveals that the **user gets most of his favorite amenities in his new city** as well. User can decide to go with any of the neighborhoods in cluster0. But **West village** is chosen due to its proximity to the target address. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have used first 10 of the user's favorite venues to reach the conclusion. This approach **can be extended to include more venues** in the future. This could make the system more robust. Also, there can be a **provision for the user to add a few extra amenities** to the list of his favorites. This will enhance the **user experience**.\n",

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude this report, a **Machine learning** based approach has been described to identify similar neighborhoods from two different cities. Location data derived from **https://foursquare.com/** has been used to solve this as a **data science problem.**  It could help people moving from one city to another to locate a neighborhood with all their favorite amenities. This is just one application of this solution and this can have a **variety of other usecases involving international travellers**."
